USD samples.     
This includes materials using MDLs that are compatible with NVIDIA Omniverse.      

## What USD ?

Pixar has defined a file format called "Universal Scene Description (USD)".

USD is more than a file format; it also acts as a framework for defining 3D scenes.     

## USD samples

I have decided to create a sample of USD files by function.     

### Primitive

|File|Material Type|Description|      
|---|---|---|      
|[simple_primitives.usda](samples/primitive/simple_primitives.usda)|-|Placement of Cube,Sphere,Cylinder,Capsule,Cone<br>![imple_primitives](samples/primitive/images/simple_primitives.jpg)|      

### Light

|File|Material Type|Description|      
|---|---|---|      
|[point_light.usda](samples/light/point_light.usda)|-|Point Light with Sphere Light.<br>Use the ratio of radius to surface area to achieve the same light intensity<br>![point_light](samples/light/images/point_light.jpg)|      
|[spot_light.usda](samples/light/spot_light.usda)|-|Spot Light with Sphere Light.<br>Change in Cone Angle and Cone Softness.<br>![spot_light](samples/light/images/spot_light.jpg)|
